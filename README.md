## 🚀 Project Report: Career Path Finder

### Project Name
 Career Path Finder  

### Problem Statement: The Challenge of Post-SSLC Selection
 Students completing their SSLC (Secondary School Leaving Certificate) frequently make suboptimal choices regarding their academic stream or degree path due to a lack of comprehensive awareness about the available options . They often gravitate towards popular or familiar choices rather than those best suited to their aptitudes and interests, which can significantly impact their future academic and career trajectories.

### Current Solution Landscape and Limitations
Existing solutions for career guidance face several limitations:

| Solution | Problem/Limitation |
| :--- | :--- |
|  **Career Counselling Platforms**   |  They charge fees for service, making them unaffordable for everyone . |
| **Seeking Advice from Elders**   |  Elders may not possess knowledge about a student's specific interest field ("everyone don't know everything") |
| **Using the Internet (Google, ChatGPT, Bard.ai)**   |  Google is often unhelpful , AI applications are trained on specific data , and many people lack the skill to effectively use the internet for this purpose . |

### Proposed Solution: Career Path Finder
The Career Path Finder application is designed to act as a **personalized career compass** to solve the post-SSLC decision-making challenge It provides students with the clarity and insight needed to confidently choose their next academic steps .

####  How the Application Empowers Students

1.  **Comprehensive Exploration of All Options:**
    *  The application addresses the issue of limited student awareness by providing a **holistic view** of every viable academic and career option available after SSLC .
2.  **Identifying the Shortest and Most Efficient Paths:**
    *  It helps students by illustrating typical academic progressions (Mapping Progression) .  This shows how a specific stream or diploma can lead to an undergraduate degree and, eventually, to a desired career goal .
3.  **Personalized Matching Based on Interests and Aptitudes:**
    *  To ensure long-term career satisfaction , the application uses **Interest-Based Filtering** .
    *  Students can input their passions, favorite subjects, hobbies, and personality traits .
    * The application then filters and prioritizes options that align with these inputs.

### Current Status and Technology
*  **Prototype:** A Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been created using **Python** and its library, **Tkinter** .
*  **Development Focus:** The project is currently being developed into a fully functional website .
* **Key Features Planned for the Website:**
    *  Explore career options  
    * "What next after" tool  
    *  "Find all ways to your dreams" functionality  
    *  Dynamic text boxes to display different options (e.g., "10th, engineering, mbbs")  
    *  Interface to break down all available options  and suggest the next step towards a dream career .

 **Note:** The user interface design is currently basic but is planned to be changed, and it demonstrates all core features.
