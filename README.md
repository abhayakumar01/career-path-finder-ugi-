## 🚀 Project Report: Career Path Finder

### Project Name
[cite_start]Career Path Finder [cite: 1, 2]

### Problem Statement: The Challenge of Post-SSLC Selection
[cite_start]Students completing their SSLC (Secondary School Leaving Certificate) frequently make suboptimal choices regarding their academic stream or degree path due to a lack of comprehensive awareness about the available options[cite: 3, 4, 5]. [cite_start]They often gravitate towards popular or familiar choices rather than those best suited to their aptitudes and interests, which can significantly impact their future academic and career trajectories[cite: 6, 7].

### Current Solution Landscape and Limitations
Existing solutions for career guidance face several limitations:

| Solution | Problem/Limitation |
| :--- | :--- |
| [cite_start]**Career Counselling Platforms** [cite: 9] | [cite_start]They charge fees for service, making them unaffordable for everyone[cite: 10, 11]. |
| [cite_start]**Seeking Advice from Elders** [cite: 12] | [cite_start]Elders may not possess knowledge about a student's specific interest field ("everyone don't know everything")[cite: 13, 14]. |
| [cite_start]**Using the Internet (Google, ChatGPT, Bard.ai)** [cite: 15] | [cite_start]Google is often unhelpful [cite: 17][cite_start], AI applications are trained on specific data [cite: 18][cite_start], and many people lack the skill to effectively use the internet for this purpose[cite: 19]. |

### Proposed Solution: Career Path Finder
[cite_start]The Career Path Finder application is designed to act as a **personalized career compass** to solve the post-SSLC decision-making challenge[cite: 22, 24]. [cite_start] It provides students with the clarity and insight needed to confidently choose their next academic steps[cite: 22, 24].

#### [cite_start]How the Application Empowers Students [cite: 26]

1.  **Comprehensive Exploration of All Options:**
    * [cite_start]The application addresses the issue of limited student awareness by providing a **holistic view** of every viable academic and career option available after SSLC[cite: 28, 29].
2.  **Identifying the Shortest and Most Efficient Paths:**
    * [cite_start]It helps students by illustrating typical academic progressions (Mapping Progression)[cite: 31, 32, 33]. [cite_start]This shows how a specific stream or diploma can lead to an undergraduate degree and, eventually, to a desired career goal[cite: 33].
3.  **Personalized Matching Based on Interests and Aptitudes:**
    * [cite_start]To ensure long-term career satisfaction [cite: 35][cite_start], the application uses **Interest-Based Filtering**[cite: 37].
    * [cite_start]Students can input their passions, favorite subjects, hobbies, and personality traits[cite: 37].
    * [cite_start]The application then filters and prioritizes options that align with these inputs[cite: 38].

### Current Status and Technology
* [cite_start]**Prototype:** A Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been created using **Python** and its library, **Tkinter**[cite: 39].
* [cite_start]**Development Focus:** The project is currently being developed into a fully functional website[cite: 42].
* **Key Features Planned for the Website:**
    * [cite_start]Explore career options [cite: 43]
    * [cite_start]"What next after" tool [cite: 44]
    * [cite_start]"Find all ways to your dreams" functionality [cite: 45]
    * [cite_start]Dynamic text boxes to display different options (e.g., "10th, engineering, mbbs") [cite: 46]
    * [cite_start]Interface to break down all available options [cite: 51, 53] [cite_start]and suggest the next step towards a dream career[cite: 52].

[cite_start]**Note:** The user interface design is currently basic but is planned to be changed, and it demonstrates all core features[cite: 41].
